/**
 * Annotation to log the runtime performance of a method.
 * When applied to a method, this annotation allows logging
 * the time taken for the method execution. The logging level
 * can be specified using the value property.
 * <p>
 * Logging is performed by intercepting method calls,
 * and the logged information typically includes the method name
 * and the elapsed time in milliseconds.
 * <p>
 * The default logging level is INFO unless specified otherwise.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is supported by the {@code LogPermancePostProcessor},
 * which utilizes a method interceptor to calculate and log execution time.
 * <p>
 * Attributes:
 * - {@code value}: The logging level for performance logs. Defaults to {@code Level.INFO}.
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * Apply this annotation to public methods to measure and log their performance.
